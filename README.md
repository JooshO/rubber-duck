# HAL-9000 Group Final Project - CS4811 S23

This project is a terminal based chatbot meant to help debug code in the style of Rubber Duck debugging

Since we are using some stuff from NLTK, you need to run install.py in order to use it.
If one of them fails to download or takes too long, you can get it directly from [the source](https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
or you can extract the nltk_data.zip to wherever it says it is looking for files (usually ```home/<username>``` on a linux setup)

Once the NLTK data is setup, you can execute the program just by running ```python main.py```.

Try telling the bot that "My code keeps segfaulting" to see a regular output message, and ask it if it could "Please go over my code".
After letting it quack at your inputs for a bit, let it know that "I am done reviewing my code" and then tell it to "exit" to finish the demo.
