# HAL-9000 Group Final Project - CS4811 S23

This project is a terminal based chatbot meant to help debug code in the style of Rubber Duck debugging

Using some stuff from NLTK, need to run install.py in order to use it.
If one of them fails to download or takes too long, you can get it directly from [the source](https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
or you can extract the nltk_data.zip to wherever it says it is looking for files (usually ```home/<username>``` on a linux setup)
